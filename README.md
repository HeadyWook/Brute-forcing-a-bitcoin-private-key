A Python program that uses 41 of 52 characters in a private key as shown on
https://tweetstamp.org/1340675592119857154/. The global variable "CYCLES" sets the number of whole private keys that
will be produced in the output. This program randomizes a string and appends it to the end of the partial private key to
produce 52 of 52 characters. The user can then copy and paste the whole private key in to a wallet to sweep. The sweep
can also be done by scanning a QR code. A QR code of the private key can be generated by pasting the raw text produced
by this program to a QR code generator, such as https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/. If the correct private key is
produced then that user can claim the bitcoin on it. Good luck.
